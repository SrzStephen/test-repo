# Testing stuff

## Purpose
I find myself using frameworks like [serverless-framework](https://www.serverless.com/) too much for AWS stuff and I
feel that I need to try to learn a bit more about the more "AWSy" way to do things.

This has become pretty obvious when a hackathon I was doing resulted in "here's Serverless.yml to deploy most stuff, and 
here's some CLI commands to provision other resources".

## Functionality
This is more a learning kind of thing, so it's mostly "Do something basic but do it in a different way than I'm used to"

I want to get some basic things from my phone (currently how long I'm on the phone for and periodic location checkins).

It seems like the easiest way without having to do some annoying stuff to get an always on service on my phone is to use
[Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_AU&gl=US) because it lets me
quickly set up some "Send web request to X with Y info" kind of tasks.

## Goals
* Learn Cloudformation (and see when it makes sense to go through [SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification-template-anatomy.html)
  instead of raw cloudformation)
  
* Learn how to properly set up Cloudformation
  
* Learn how to do proper testing
